I'm passionate about retro gaming hardware, and aim to be a resource for people in my community who are trying to repair or restore their games and consoles.

## Parts and Labor

**I charge only for labor — you provide the parts or I can source them for you at cost.**

Whether you already have the components or need me to order them, I'll handle the technical installation and setup while you only pay for the service work.

**I'm not trying to make a living doing this.**

For some quick tasks, I only ask that you name your price – just buy me a beer, or a pack of diapers for my baby! But if it'll use up my evening, I'll charge it to make it worth my time.

## Professional Equipment & Quality Assurance

**I've got the right tools for the job.**

Most of what makes many of these tasks out of reach is the amount of special equipment you need – special screwdrivers, precision soldering tools, flux, solder wick, the works – I've already bought all this and I know how to use it.

**I don't want to mess your stuff up either.**

I'm not interested in trying something for the first time on your priceless childhood console – I won't agree to do anything I'm not confident doing, and haven't done before on my own hardware.

## Services

### Consulting — Always Free!

- I just like taking about this stuff.
- I've done lots of mods, and bought a lot of these things! I can make recommendations, or even tell you about solutions you didn't know were on the market.
- Check out my posts in the "Guides" section for more of this like my big list of [[Retro Handhelds]].

### Cleaning and Restoration Services

- **General Maintenance and Cleanup** – I'll take it apart, scrub it with isopropyl alcohol and put it back together with my "no leftover screws" guarantee.
- **Gameboy Screen Lens Replacement** – GBs benefit from a glass lens, the plastic ones scratched too easily.
- **Sharpie Removal** — Who among us didn't write our names on our cartridges, or bought one from someone who did? Elbow grease and isopropyl to the rescue.
