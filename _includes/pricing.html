        <h2>Parts and Labor</h2>
        <div class="pricing-content">
            <p><strong>I charge only for labor — you provide the parts or I can source them for you at cost.</strong></p>
            <p>Whether you already have the components or need me to order them, I'll handle the technical installation and setup while you only pay for the service work.</p>
            <p><strong>I'm not trying to make a living doing this.</strong></p>
            <p>For some quick tasks, I only ask that you name your price – just buy me a beer, or a pack of diapers for my baby! But if it'll use up my evening, I'll charge it to make it worth my time.</p>
